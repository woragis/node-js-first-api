# Purpose of this Repo

## Learn everything possible about Node

# Why?

## Node is the fastest backend API

and I think that's pretty much everything that matters to a website
and in situations with many requests node isn't far behind
so even in the worst possible case, it's not worse
and in the rest of it, it's just better than everything else
